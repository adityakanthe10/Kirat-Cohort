## Week 19.4 Redis, Pub Subs and Queues

### Redis

- Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database cache, and message broker.

- One of the key features of redis is its ability to keep its all data in memory, which allows for high performance and low latency access to data.

### In memory data structure store
- Very similar to a DB, only it is in memory. That doesnâ€™t mean it doesnâ€™t have persistence
- RDB (Redis Database File): The RDB persistence performs point-in-time snapshots of your dataset at specified intervals. It creates a compact single-file representation of the entire Redis dataset. The snapshotting process can be configured to run at specified intervals, such as every X minutes if Y keys have changed.

```
save 900 1       # Save the dataset every 900 seconds if at least 1 key changed
save 300 10      # Save the dataset every 300 seconds if at least 10 keys changed
save 60 10000    # Save the dataset every 60 seconds if at least 10000 keys changed
```

- AOF (Append Only File): The AOF persistence logs every write operation received by the server, appending each operation to a file. This file can then be replayed on startup to reconstruct the dataset. 

### Starting Redis locally

- Letâ€™s start redis locally and start using it as a DB
```
docker run --name my-redis -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

- Connecting to your container
```
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash
```

- Connecting to the redis cli
```
redis-cli
```

### Redis as a DB

- SET/GET/DEL
- Setting data
```
SET mykey "Hello" 
```

- Getting data
```
GET mykey
```

- Deleting data
```
DEL mykey
```
 
- HSET/HGET/HDEL (H = Hash)
```
HSET user:100 name "John Doe" email "user@example.com" age "30"
HGET user:100 name
HGET user:100 email
```

- ðŸ’¡You should never use redis as your primary database

- You can also push to a topic / queue on Redis and other processes can pop from it.

- Pushing to a queue
```
LPUSH problems 1
LPUSH problems 2
```
 
- Popping from a queue
```
RPOP problems
RPOP problems 
```
 
- Blocked pop
```
BRPOP problems 0
BRPOP problems 30
```

 - The last argument represents the timeout before the blocking should be stopped


 ### Talking To Redis via Node.js

-  Express Server
```
import express from "express";
import { createClient } from "redis";

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

const client = createClient();
client.on('error', (err) => console.log('Redis Client Error', err));

app.post("/submit", async (req, res) => {
    const problemId = req.body.problemId;
    const code = req.body.code;
    const language = req.body.language;

    try {
        await client.lPush("problems", JSON.stringify({ code, language, problemId }));
        // Store in the database
        res.status(200).send("Submission received and stored.");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Redis error:", error);
        res.status(500).send("Failed to store submission.");
    }
});

async function startServer() {
    try {
        await client.connect();
        console.log("Connected to Redis");

        app.listen(3000, () => {
            console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to connect to Redis", error);
    }
}

startServer();
```

Create Worker

```
import { createClient } from "redis";
const client = createClient();

async function processSubmission(submission: string) {
    const { problemId, code, language } = JSON.parse(submission);

    console.log(`Processing submission for problemId ${problemId}...`);
    console.log(`Code: ${code}`);
    console.log(`Language: ${language}`);
    // Here you would add your actual processing logic

    // Simulate processing delay
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    console.log(`Finished processing submission for problemId ${problemId}.`);
}

async function startWorker() {

    try {
        await client.connect();
        console.log("Worker connected to Redis.");

        // Main loop
        while (true) {
            try {
                const submission = await client.brPop("problems", 0);
                // @ts-ignore
                await processSubmission(submission.element);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error processing submission:", error);
                // Implement your error handling logic here. For example, you might want to push
                // the submission back onto the queue or log the error to a file.
            }
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to connect to Redis", error);
    }
}

startWorker();
```
