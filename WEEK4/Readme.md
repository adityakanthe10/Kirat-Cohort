# 4.1 fetch need to be asynchronous 

- Debouncing - 
Delays the function execution until a specified time has passed without the event being triggered again . Useful for actions that should only occur after the user has stopped triggering the event. (e.g. submitting a search query after typing has stopped )

- Throttling - Ensures the function is executed at regular intervals,regardless of how often the event is trriggered. Useful for actions that should occur at a controlled rate (e.g. updating a scroll position or handling mouse movements)
