# WEEK 5

## Week 5.1

- React is used as it makes DOM Manipulation easier for dynamic websites .

- React is just aneasier way to write HTML, CSS and Javascript .It's a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted into HTML, CSS and Javascript .

- Creators of frontend frameworks realised that all websites can be divided into two parts :- State and Components .

- State
    - An object that represents the current state of the App .It represents the dynamic things(things that change) in your app .

- Components
    - How a DOM Element should render, given a state . It is re-usable dynamic,HTML snippet that changes given the state .

A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated when the state changes . You usually have to define all your components once .And then all you have to do is update the state of the app, React takes care of re-rendering your app .

- npm run build : This command converts the xml to js.
