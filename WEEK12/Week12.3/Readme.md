## DOcker 

1. Docker lets you do a lot of things
    a. It let's you containerize the applications.
    b. It let's you run other people's  code + packages in your machine.
    c. It let's you run common software packages inside a container (For eg PostgreSQL,mongoDB,etc)
2. Just like we push code to github we push images to docker registries.
