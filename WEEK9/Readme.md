    -  Hooks are a feature introduced in React16.8 that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.They are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

- Custom Hooks - 

    -   Hooks that you create yourself, so other people can use them are called custom hooks.
    -   A custom hook is effectively a function, but with the following properties - 
        1. Uses another hook internally (useState,useEffect,another custom hooks)
        2. Starts with use .

    - A few examples are 
        1. Data fetching hooks .

        4. Performance/Timer based - useInterval,useDebounce .
